# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. 

## Usage
W build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically weather updates, which will allow users to view current weather in their city.
